                            <p>Gold Subscription: Monthly cleaning for all bins.</p>
                            <p>Silver Subscription: Quarterly cleaning for all bins.</p>

                            <p>$0 cancellation Fee, however, cancellations prior to the completion of the initial six cycles, will incur the retention of 50% of the Gold Subscription Plan Free. Cancellations after the 6th cleaning cycle, processed up to 48h prior to the next cleaning cycle will receive the total value of the remaining outstanding cleaning cycles. </p>
                            
                            <h3>Silver Subscription (Paid Annually, Quarterly Cleaning Cycle for All Three Bins):</h3>
                            <p>If you cancel your Silver Subscription prior to the completion of the initial two quarterly cleaning cycles, you will receive a refund of the remaining cleaning cycles, with a retention fee of 50% of the total Silver Subscription Plan fee. This retention fee is to cover the administrative costs associated with your subscription and to ensure fair usage of the annual subscription plan.</p>

                            <h3>Bronze Subscription (Paid Monthly, Monthly Cleaning Cycle for up to 3 bins of your choice):</h3>
                            <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time. To ensure fair usage of the monthly subscription plan, if you cancel your Bronze Subscription after the first cleaning cycle and before the second cycle, you will still be charged for the second cycle. This is to discourage customers from using the monthly subscription plan for a single cleaning and then canceling to avoid paying  a higher rate for a one-off clean.</p>
                            
                            <h3>One-Off Clean (Customers Choose 1-3 Bins):</h3>
                            <p>Cancellations up to 48h prior to scheduled clean, will receive full refund. if you cancel after the 48-hour window, you will be charged for the full cleaning service. </p>
