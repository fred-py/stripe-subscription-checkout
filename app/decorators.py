"""As a rule of thumb, the route decorator from
Flask should be given first when using multiple
decorators in a view function. The remaining decorators
should be given in the order in which they need to
evaluate when the view function is invoked.
In these two cases, the user authenticated state needs to
be checked first, since the user needs to be redirected to
the login prompt if found to not be authenticated.

Permissions may also need to be checked from templates, so
the Permission class with all its constants needs to be
accessible to them. 

To avoid having to add a template argument in every
render_template() call, a context processor can be used.
Context processors make variables available to all templates
during rendering. This change is shown in ExampleÂ 9-8.""" # Page 340
